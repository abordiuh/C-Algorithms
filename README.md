#Template Linked List
Overview
********
Usual Linked List implementation in C must have specific type of data to be held. In case if
user wants to create another linked list with it’s own data, he need to write basicly a new
linked list for it. Functions for adding the data to the list must be written based on this
specific type.

Another point is that if user want to insert data to a specific index of a linked list, the list must
initialize itself first with empty nodes up to that index (if index exceed size of a list) and after
take care of inserting data to this place. The worst thing here is that all empty nodes for
example for integer value are not really empty and takes memory away (if the data of a linked
list not a pointer).

Template Linked List (TLL) will handle all initial steps of creating nodes with specific data
type and creating functions to insert this data. Moreover, user can create as much TTL with
different data types as he wants in a very simple steps. At the end interface of doing this is
simple, most work with a memory has already done by TTL algorithm and user just need to
keep track of what kind of data in the list. TTL is a nested implementation of some of C++
templates usage.

How it’s works
****************
First the header needs to be included:

# include "TemplatedLinkedList.h"

After user need to declare in the same way as global variable will be:

typedef TLinkedList(MyNodeName, int) MyTLinkListInt;
CreateFuncForTLinkedList(MyTLinkListInt, int);

where:
MyNodeName - Name of the node (struct) (user don’t require to use it later)
int - Data type (can be any, but not ”char *”, for string separate typedef of
struct containing char[] need to be initialized and passed)
MyTLinkListInt - It is a name of node of a linked list

CreateFuncForTLinkedList will define functions which can be used to add data to the list.
Each function name will start with a name of node of a linked list + _funcName. For
example, MyTLinkListInt_push(...)

These two commands need to be used only in the order shown above!

At the end our template linked list can be used in these ways:

//Header of a linked list (must be declared as NULL)
MyTLinkListInt *myTListS = NULL;
int number = 0;
// Insert the data into Linked List to the end
MyTLinkListInt_push(&myTListS, &(number));
MyTLinkListInt_replaceByIndex(&myTListI, &(number), 5);

printMyListInt(&myTListS){
MyTLinkListInt *ptrCurrentNode = *head;
int indexCounter = 0;
while (ptrCurrentNode != NULL) {
if (ptrCurrentNode->data != NULL)
printf("Node %d: %d\r\n", indexCounter, *(ptrCurrentNode->data));
ptrCurrentNode = ptrCurrentNode->next;
